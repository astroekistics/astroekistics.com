        <p><strong>Redefining the Future of Sustainable Human Settlement</strong></p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Our website is <strong>coming soon</strong>, but we’re excited to share the vision and purpose of the Institute of Astro-ekistics (IOaE).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Purpose of IOaE</h2>
            <p>The **Institute of Astro-ekistics (IOaE)** stands at the intersection of ecology, technology, and humanity’s collective ambition to create sustainable, thriving settlements beyond traditional boundaries. At its core, the IOaE is a vision for the future—a future where human life is seamlessly integrated into the ecological systems that sustain it, both on Earth and in the stars.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

            <h3>The Vision: SELSS</h3>
            <p>Central to our mission is the development of **Socio-Ecological Life Support Systems (SELSS)**. These systems are not just machines; they are living, breathing ecosystems where humans and nature coexist in harmony. A SELSS functions as a closed-loop system, recycling resources and supporting life in confined environments like space habitats or Earth-based arcologies.</p>
            <p>Imagine a settlement where waste becomes a resource, food is grown within the same walls that shelter its people, and every action contributes to the health of the whole. This is the foundation of SELSS and the future IOaE is building.</p>

            <h3>The Guide: Project Shepherdess</h3>
            <p>To sustain these intricate ecosystems, we are developing **Project Shepherdess**. This is not merely an AI system—it is envisioned as the guiding consciousness of a SELSS. Like a shepherd tending their flock, the Shepherdess monitors and nurtures the delicate balance of life within the system.</p>
            <p>More than a tool, the Shepherdess is a partner, helping humanity navigate the challenges of confined living and fostering a deeper connection to the systems that sustain life.</p>

            <h3>The Builders: ACE Corps</h3>
            <p>To bring these systems to life and expand them across new frontiers, the IOaE is cultivating the **Astro-ecistic Corps of Engineers (ACE Corps)**. This pioneering group of experts will be the first to inhabit and maintain SELSS-based settlements. They are stewards of life, trained to nurture ecosystems and adapt them to diverse environments.</p>
            <p>The ACE Corps will carry the knowledge and technology of SELSS to new sites, laying the groundwork for communities that can thrive independently of traditional industrial systems.</p>
